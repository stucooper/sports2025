ROUND 1
=======
I'm not sure if I want 26 different diary files but last year I tried
one huge diary file and it became unwieldy. Maybe month-by-month diary files
will be the correct length but for now I'll do week-by-week diaries.

I was fairly interested in the League this week; both with the Vegas
games a week ago and the traditional Thursday-Sunday rest of the
round. I got 5/5 betting from a Friday night bet but I combined that
with the 2 AFL Round 0 games, both of which I got wrong.

I'd played a lot of poker tournaments at St George Leagues club and
was tempted to play Saturday before the 5:30pm St George v Bulldogs
game but in the event I did other things with my time. I did spend a
lot of time close to Kogarah Jubilee Oval so I felt close to the
League.

I didn't feel a strong urge to watch any of the games, I saw the last
two minutes of the Friday night of Souths v Redcliffe during the
third-quarter break of Swans v Hawthorn. NRL is enjoyable for me at
about this level of commitment and the $35 tipping competition through
Martin Stewart makes it fun also.

Let me check and record my performance in that tipping competition
through the magic of the iTipFooty app:

With 6 out of a possible 8 points, sendit2025 is equal 3rd out of 44
tippers; there are 2 tippers with 7 points, 11 more (including me)
with 6 points, 14 more with 5 points and so on.

I'll do the Round 2 Fixtures up now and see if there's anything
interesting coming up, league-wise.
