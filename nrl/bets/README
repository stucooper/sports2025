Filename ptw_roundNN.txt are records of Pick the Winners (ptw) bets.
There is a script nrl/bin/ptwscore.pl that "scores" the ptw bets
against the results; showing the pick the winner selection, the score,
the adjusted score with the points start added or subtracted, and the
running tally of our ptw score for this round.

Best result so far was Round 8 a heartbreak 7/8. According to the TAB
website, Pick the Winners paid $158 for the correct 8/8. 2^8 is $256
so it's not possible to box 8 selections and make a profit.

Files called roundNN.txt are freeform text descriptions of my betting
for the round.

I might add extra bets (from the paper notebook) into this directory
and write new betchecking programs; it's all good programming practice.
