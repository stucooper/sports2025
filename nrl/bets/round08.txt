Heartbreak in H2H and Pick the Winners as Penrith let me down
losing 10-26 to Manly on the Saturday night.

H2H $3@64
BRI 2.50/ROO 1.77/AUK 1.35/MEL 1.18/NQL 1.42/PEN 1.48/CAN 1.58/WTI 2.75

The final WTI game was a 18-18 80 minute but WTI won 20-18 in Golden
Point (by a penalty by the look of things)

PTW $1
BRI+5.5|SYD-1.5|AUK-9.5|SOU+15.5|NQL-6.5|PEN-7.5|CAN-4.5|WTI+7.5

Let's see if I can find the dividend for PTW (only one I got wrong
was Penrith and that 18-18 80 minute draw doesn't matter anymore)

Internet suggests $158; not much for an 8 from 8 so there were
probably a few winners (1.90**8 = 169 and it costs $256 to box all
8 games).

Oh well, a rare 7/8 heartbreak in the NRL. My NRL tipping is normally
terrible so getting this close for the heartbreak should be considered
some kind of anomaly.
