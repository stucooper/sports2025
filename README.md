# sports2025

Sports bets, programming support for stucooper NRL and AFL 2025.

Might be some database files, python programs, perl programs,
spreadsheets etc. Hopefully this should be fun.

Each sport nrl and afl should have three directories with one text
file per round (later games at the bottom)

fixtures/round01.txt
tips/round01.txt
results/round01.txt

AFL sucks as they have an "Opening Round" == Round 00 to try and
promote the game in Sydney/Queensland so AFL counts from 00 not 01.
