I've watched a lot of the footy shows this week; main talking points
are Jamarra Ugle-Hagan's ongoing issues at the Western Bulldogs and plenty
of analysis of just how slow and crap Collingwood were against GWS.

Anyhow let's look at the upcoming Round 01 games and think about what
I might want to watch this weekend.

Thursday night Richmond seem so terrible that I doubt I'll stay interested
in the match for long; even though it will be fun to see a big MCG crowd
on the TV and make fun of desparate Richmond fans.

Friday night Hawthorn v Essendon looks pretty interesting; Hawthorn were
good to watch last week and should be good to watch this week.

Saturday Swans v Brisbane looks to be the second game; check the timeslot
they play at 4:15pm that should be good for a watch especially if I'm not
doing so great at the races that day.

Actually does a Randwick/SCG double make any sense? Nope, horseracing is
at Rosehill or Gosford that day. Might just be a long extended afternoon
at the pub!

Sunday we've got Melbourne v GWS at the MCG game is at 3:20pm. This feels
like another watch at a club and can lead into a 6:00pm League game,
Bulldogs at Belmore.

NRL to look out for:
Thursday Knight is Knights v Redcliffe in Newcastle, always nice to
see a bit of Newcastle on the TV. Friday night early is Auckland v
Manly, second game Penrith v Roosters, little interest apart from how
is my tipping going.

Saturday 3pm St George v Souths but there's Swans and horseracing on
at that time as well (this could turn into a Super Saturday afternoon,
folks). Sunday about the same time as Demons v GWS there is last
year's Wooden Spoon game, West Tigers v Parramatta. Sunday is my
birthday so I might not be devoted to footy watching on that day.
