ROUND 10
========

Thank god for the tipping competitions because there wasn't much
interesting in the bets this weekend. In the AFL I got both Sydney and
GWS wrong; you'd think that they would be my best teams since I'm in
Sydney and follow the AFL but no, I got them both wrong. GWS were
particularly dreadful against Fremantle at "Engie Stadium" on Saturday
twilight; in the cold they just never got it going. So much for Orange
Tsunamis and the like; we were flat and I left with 10 minutes to go,
the only good thing about the whole shebang was that I walked home.

The day before, Friday, I went to the Sydney Symphony Orchestra with
Yimmy for the morning 11am concert. Brahms Piano concerto Number 1,
bit of Prokofiev Romeo and Juliet to begin with and that was it for
the daytime no-intermission concert. The third work, played at two
evening concerts, was some new Aboriginal Fanfare so I'm not sorry to
have missed it.

Back to Footy. My AFL tips were going OK 4/6 going into Sunday until a
ridiculous 0/3 on the Sunday; North Melbourne defeating Richmond, West
Coast at home beating St Kilda (on the emotion of the passing of club
legend Adam Selwood) and Melbourne Demons beating Brisbane, in
Brisbane. Just as well the "Min 5" Minigame hadn't started yet because
I finish with 4/9 and would've been eliminated!

In NRL my Pick the Winners was still alive after the first 4 games,
that's getting exciting, but I only got 1 of the last 4 games so it
wasn't that exciting at all in the end.
