ROUND 0, "Opening Round"
=======================

I'm joining the chorus of AFL fans who say that Opening Round is stupid
and the early season byes are stupidly bad for the competition draw.
This year's Opening Round got even sillier with the cancellation of the
Brisband and Gold Coast games due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred, which looked
extrenely scary and luckily didn't cause as much destruction as it had
threatened before landfall.

Swans v Hawthorn I hoped to watch on my laptop in the great new age
of Seven Plus streaming the games but they had some hardware copy
protection stuff in it that my laptop (monitor/Linux) didn't support.
Fortunately my phone did so I watched the second half at home on my
phone. Next week I'll see how Yimmy's modern laptop goes as far as
watching SevenPlus live goes.

I was torn between attending GWS v Collingwood or just watching it at
the Flemington Markets Hotel, but when I got to Flemington station
there was a train to Lidcombe in just a minute so I got the train to
Olympic Park and watched most of the game. A 10 minute delay from a
neck injury to Kieran Briggs meant I got to see even more of the game
than I should have; the 3:20 game went a little bit past 6:00pm with
this delay. I was seated way up the back of the stand and it was a fun
watch from there.

My bag had a reading book (Paul Kelly/Troy Bramston The Dismissal) so
I half read/half watched the footy game. No Football Record to be
found.

Bets: My league bets were 5/5, I got both the AFL bets wrong. Perhaps
NRL is a better betting sport than Aussie Rules?

Tips: League 6/8 (Canberra wrong in Vegas, Bulldogs beat St George at
Kogarah) AFL 0/2
