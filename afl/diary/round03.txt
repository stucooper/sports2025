ROUND 3
=======

A 7/8 tipping round and the game I got wrong was the Thursday night,
Essendon/Port. Is AFL an easier tipping sport than NRL at the moment?
With some super weak teams (West Coast, Adelaide) and some reliably
winning teams (Hawthorn, Brisbane, Adelaide) it looks that way for the
moment.

Of the games themselves I wasn't motivated to watch much. These
Saturday PayTV policies are not good for the fans watching at home.
GWS lost to Hawthorn on Saturday night in Launceston in what seems an
interesting game; they were up by 34 at quarter time, and losing at
half time and the radio commentators were saying there was a howling
six goal gale favouring one end. In the third quarter Hawthorn kicked
some goals to the bad end and in the final quarter so did GWS so the
game could be quite an interesting watch when I catch up with it
through an afl.com.au download.

I feel like doing a "team strength" matrix now that all teams have
played 3 games (Hawthorn 4 but they'll get hit by a bye soon I'm
sure). This patented new Stuart technology could help increase my
tipping prowess from 7/8 to 8/8!! We'll see...
