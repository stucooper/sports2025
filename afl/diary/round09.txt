ROUND 9
=======

A frustrating round that I couldn't get very excited about.
Mark Reay finally made it back to Australia from the USA, I got
in some drinking on Thursday to warm up for meeting him Friday; on the
Friday we really hit the bottle, then I stopped off at Flemington
Markets Club and Daniel bought me even more red wine. Far too much
drinking.

Saturday was poker at Engadine and the NRL games were on the screen;
they were very good; the first two had huge halftime leads run down by
the other team and the final NRL game was a 30-30 draw.

AFL became interesting again on the Sunday with three desperately
tight games, Richmond just pipping West Coast at the MCG, GWS somehow
winning again in Geelong (fifth time in a row would you believe!) and
then my Gauntlet tip Brisbane had a 71-all draw in Hobart, which was
luckily counted by AFL tipping as a win!

So the footy got more interesting as the weekend progressed.

The games were quite topsy turvy and none of my bets looked likely,
except the Thursday night NRL was 20-12 with a few minutes to go (I
would've backed that if I'd got to the club at 755pm not 805pm) so I
was pretty happy when Parramatta scored and the score finished 20-16
to Redcliffe not 20-12.
