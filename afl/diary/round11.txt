ROUND 11
========

AFL tipping was good this week, 7/9 and the only games I got wrong
(which was a failing in last week's tipping as well) was both Sydney
teams! By the time I did my betting I'd suspected the Swans would lose
so I got a heartbreak head to head 7/8 bet $5 @ 42.58 that lost
because GWS beat Carlton in Melbourne. That game started at the
annoying time of 12:35pm Saturday; who wants to watch footy that early
on a Saturday? It's a PayTV disgrace!

NRL was only five games (State of Origin the following Wednesday, all
the stars are in camp). I got the priceless 0/5 in Head to Head
in tipping and just 1/5 in Head to Head betting. The 5/5 Head to Head
would've paid a squillion; I should look at my inverses table and
figure it out.
