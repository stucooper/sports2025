ROUND 5
=======

Sensational AFL betting performance over Gather Round; a 9 from 9 DIY
points start got up. The details are in the file
sports2025/afl/bets/round05.txt but I'll add a bit of the story and
the thrill in this file.

I was at Rooty Hill RSL (since changed to West HQ) for poker on a few
of the days including the final Sunday. I was so excited that both a
9 from 9 Head2Head was alive and my DIY line was alive. I was able
with the help of my mobile phone's calculator to calculate a decent
layoff strategy (again see the round05.txt file in the bets/
directory)

The TAB machines were all turned off by 10:15pm Sunday when the final
game was completed. I first tried Club Parramatta on Sunday 13 May,
just 10 days after their Rooftop Bar hosted my Wedding Reception,
and then I tried a nearby sports bar. The sports bar was very strange;
there was a big Canterbury Bulldogs supporter there with his
attractive young wife who bought me a beer, let me eat their now-cold
chicken and then tried to pimp his wife out to me! They didn't have a
nearby hotel and suggested that we go to my place in Flemington but I
talked my way out of this very strange situation. They were both from
Gosford and knew Matcham-Holgate when I said that Dad still held some
cricket records there (I sincerely hope that this is true Dad you must
have had a fantastic season or two there as a champion cricketer).

Driving to West HQ aka Rooty Hill RSL is bad at any time of the day
but it's better along the Great Western Highway and it's a very easy
drive home.

NRL was of very little interest this round. Newcastle Knights seem to
have abandoned their early season form and now look like
easybeats. The rest of the results look topsy-turvy to me.
