ROUND 2
=======

Am I becoming too much of a GWS fan? They had the bye this round
and I wasn't that interested in any of the other games of AFL.
I saw a bit of Hawthorn/Carlton on Thursday night, nothing on
Friday night (Newcastle poker) and the Saturday was Grahame horseraces
and Newcastle poker as well.

North Melbourne had a spanking win over the Dees who looked good
against GWS at the MCG but might actually be pretty weak this year.
Are they in Dees-pair? Dees-olation??

Swans had their first win for the year, a last gasp win against
Fremantle in Perth. As usual, the Perth teams are getting the last
game of the round on Sunday afternoon Perth time and Sunday night
Eastern time. I wonder if their fans enjoy that or if they hate it?
Things are different over in Perth.
