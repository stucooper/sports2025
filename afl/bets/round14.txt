A perfect tipping round 7/7 and a perfect H2H 7/7 betting round,
with $8 @ 22.75 becoming $182; a very nice score and a nice Facebook
picture. Here's the breakdown

 WBD | HAW  | GWS | GEE  | FRE  | POR | CAR
 1.26  1.85  3.25   1.17   1.15  1.80  1.24

This bet boils down to
4 hot favourites (1.15,1.17,1.24,1.26)
2 close favourites HAW d ADE POR d MEL (1.85, 1.80)
1 rank outsides (GWS to beat Brisbane early Saturday afternoon)

Send it! I had gambler's remorse that I didn't have a bigger stake
than $8 on this win every game Multi; too bad it's great to get a win.

I had a 7/7 DIY Multi that came close and failed because the WBD/STK
and GEE/ESS results were both 40+ blowouts. I'll write that bet into
this report as well

WBD 1-39 | HAW 1-39 | GWS +20.5 | GEE 1-39 | NOR +31.5 | POR 1-39 | CAR 1-39
(L) 2.05       2.25       1.90    (L) 2.05       1.90        2.25     2.05
$5 @ 157.42

I've got a feeling that if I'd taken points start 1.90 the whole way I
might've won this and points start might be a safer bet than 1-39 or
40+ margins. I've had some single bet margin heartbreaks over the
years, and fewer (but still some) points start heartbreaks. The
dividend difference between 1.90 and 2.05/2.25 isnt that great if it
means costing you your bet!

7/7 points start 1.9^7 odds are 89.39 so a 7/7 all points start is
$5 * 89.38 = $446.93. The bet as I placed it was $5 @ 157.44 = $770 so
actually a fair bit of difference; but as I said just now, not worth
the extra returns if it makes you lose your bet!
