I said last week that NRL might be a better betting sport than AFL.
After the first 3 games of the AFL season my tipping is 0 from 3
but that didn't stop me having an AFL winners multi

HAW 1.30/GEE 1.43/SYD 2.15/WBL 1.35/COL 1.58/ADE 1.32/GWS 1.77/WCT 2.45
$5 @ 48.80

I won the Friday night and the Saturday Geelong easily, but the
Sydney Swans lost a tight game against Brisbane (4 points).
Western Bulldogs won and Collingwood romped Port Adelaide MCG Saturday night.
(for some reason I'd tipped Port which was a dumb tip).

Thursday night not in my bet was the upset of all upsets young Richmond
beating Carlton, I certainly didn't tip that and wouldn't have had it in
a multi winners bet.

I might put on a Sunday NRL+League winners just to get more action
this round.
