Each team's player list in increasing jersey number order.
Jersey SURNAME GIVEN NAMES
37 Goodes Adam

sort -k2 SYD.txt will give an alphabetically ordered list of the club

There are Category A and Category B "rookies" indicated by (A) and (B)
The Category B rookies can only play to replace a long-term injured player.

On Tuesday 25th February 20250225 14 SSP Pre-Season Supplemental
Selection Program players were announced. I don't know the Jersey
numbers of some of these players yet so I'll put them in as
100,101... for each club until I discover the correct Jersey
numbers. Some players were Category A rookies or even on the club's
list anyhow so I'm assuming the jersey is correct and still marking
them as SSP.

The Eagles had a potential signing hijacked by Melbourne after Jack
Henderson opted to join the Demons, remarkably just a day after
playing in West Coast's match simulation against Richmond.

(Henderson was not in my list of WCT.txt players before and is a new
SSP addition to MEL.txt)

If ever there's a midseason draft with player changes this entire
exercise of having players in text files will become very very
tricky! There's a Mid-Season Rookie Draft if clubs have rooms on their
list; Melbourne Demons are said to be one such club.

Jersey number will be increasing and unique across the file.

If there are players with the same surname (brothers) then
some convoluted double sort might get their names in order.
There are two Ashcrofts in Brisbane and two Camporeale brothers at
Carlton and two Warners in Sydney, who take swings at each other in
practice games.
