sort -k2 SYD.txt will give an alphabetically ordered list of the club

There are Category A and Category B "rookies" indicated by (A) and (B)
The Category B rookies can only play to replace a long-term injured player.

If there are players with the same surname (brothers) then
some convoluted double sort might get their names in order.
There are two Ashcrofts in Brisbane and two Camporeale brothers at
