The Biggest scandals of the century in Australian Football
by Michael Warner

Since the turn of the century, dozens of controversies have made their
way to the front page of the nation's newspapers. We list the biggest
off-field scandals and sagas to tain the code since 2000.

1. ESSENDON DRUGS SAGA

Foot's greatest scandal broke on February 5, 2013, when Essendon coach
James Hird, president David Evans and chief executive Ian Robson
fronted a snap press conference at AFL House in Docklands to
"self-report" the club's use of "exotic substances" during the 2012
season. It was the beginning of a four-year saga that would rip the
game to shreds, destroy life-long friendships and expose the seedy
underbelly of the AFL's justice system. The Bombers were smashed -
first by being removed from the 2013 finals under a contentious deal
with the AFL - and later in 2015 when 34 of its players were wiped out
for doping by the International Court of Abritration for Sport,
forcing the league to strip Jobe Watson of his 2012 Brownlow
Medal. The drugs saga took its darkest turn in 2017 when exiled
Essendon coach James Hird attempted to take his own life. Essendon has
never fully recovered.

2. WAYNE CAREY AFFAIR

The king of football led North Melbourne to premiership glory in 1996
and 1999 before a secret affair with Kelli Stevens, the wife of
teammate Anthony Stevens, blew his career and the Kangaroos apart in
March 2002. The affair was exposed after the pair were seen together
in a toilet during a party at teammate Glenn Archer's home. Carey quit
the Roos at a teary press conference and shifted to play for Adelaide,
but his game was never the same. Tensions over the scandal have
lingered ever since. When Steven's son River was drafted by North last
year, Kelli implored the football world to move on from the saga. "The
past is where it belongs - behind us." Carey said in 2022 the affair
had haunted him for the past 20 years.

3. EAGLES DRUG CRISIS

A culture of rampant illicit drug abuse at the Eagles exploded into
public view after the club's 2006 premiership triumph, headlined by
the fall of drug-addled pin-up boy Ben Cousins. A top-secret AFL
report into the crisis laid bare the toxic nature of the drug-fuelled
crisis and the club's attempt to cover it up. Cocaine, speed, ice,
ecstasy, marijuana and prescription drugs were abused by numerous
Eagles players from as early as 1998. In an incident during an
end-of-season trip to Las Vegas, midfielder Chad Fletcher was strapped
to a hospital bed after collapsing and "flat-lining". Inexplicably the
Eaglers were never punished by the AFL for breinging the game into
disrepute. The scandal also exposed serious flaws with the game's
so-called three-strikes illicit drugs testing policy.

4. ALISHA HORAN DIES

In February 2000, Geelong barmaid Alisha Horan overdosed and died from
a lethal cocktail of alcohol, ecstasy, amphetamines and heroin in room
1265 at Melbourne's Hyatt Park Hotel after a drug-fuelled bender with
Cats great Gary Ablett Sr. Ablett was later convicted and fined for
possession and use of heroin and ecstasy. Horan's family has never
forgiven Ablett, who was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame five years
later amid furore over whether it was appropriate. Ablett said in 2020
"I can't tell you how much that shattered me, how much it broke me as
a person. It sto;; grives me to this day."

5. CARLTON SALARY CAP

Carlton was brought to its knees in 2002 after an AFL investigation
found the club guilty of systemic salary cap breaching. Through brazen
under-the-table cash payments or elaborate company trust structures,
Blues players pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars outside the
rules. Carlton was fined almost $1m and stripped of two seasons of
prized draft selections. Then-AFL chief executive Wayne Jackson
declared Carlton "deserved everything they got, and arguably, some
more".

6. NELBOURNE TANKING

Am AFL probe into claims Melbourne had deliberately lost matches in
2009 to secure the first two picks in the national draft was launched
in 2012 after ex-Demon Brock McLean blew the whistle on national
television. The AFL announced its findings in February 2013, declaring
Melbourne had not "tanked" to lose matches. Instead, the club was
fined $500,000 and coach Dean Bailey and footy boss Chris Connolly
were suspended for the lesser charge of conduct prejudicial to the
interests of the game. The AFL's then deputy chief, Gillon McLachlan,
famously declared "I actually don't know what the definition of
tanking is." But in 2019, the Herald Sun published 80 pages of secret
AFL integrity unit transcripts, exposing how several club officials
had indeed confessed to a conspiracy to lose matches, including a
stunning confession from Bailey. "What was said to me was, if I win
games I would get sacked," he said. "I was threatened.. it was a
terrible thing."

7. HAWTHORN RACISM

SHocking claims a young Indigenous Hawks player and his partner were
pressured by club officials to terminate a pregnancy amid a subculture
of racism at Hawthorn during the club's goldern premiership era of
2008-15 were first aired by the ABC in grand final week 2022,
triggering an eight-month AFL investigation. But the probe fizzled out
with leage boss Gillon McLachlan revealing at a snap press conference
in May 2023 that the league had struck a deal with lawyers for the
Indigenous players in which "no adverse findings have been made
against any of the indivduals against whom allegations have been
made". The dispute was later settled out of court.

8. KING KONG GAFFE

Praised for his immediate response after Adam Goodes was called an
"Ape" by a 13-year-old girl at a match between Sydney and Collingwood
in 2013, Eddie McGuire's goodwill faded days later after a shocking
gaffe on Triple M radio. When live on air, McGuire suggested the Swans
legend be used to promote the King Kong musical. Goodes, who would go
on to win Australian of the Year in 2014, was devastated while the
Swans demanded action from the AFL. McGuire apologised and conceded he
"was on heavy-duty painkillers" when he made the comments, but he was
not punished by the league. Te gaffe was part of a chain of events
that culminated in the booing of Goodes by crowds across the
country. THe dual Brownlow Medallist never fully engaged with the game
he dominated after his 2015 retirement.

9. "DO BETTER"

COllingwood's decision during the 2020 season to commission a report
into historic allegations of racism at the club blew up spectacularly
in its face. The club kept the "Do Better" report - which found there
had been a culture of "Systemic racism" at the Piews - uder weaps
before it was leaked in February 2021. At a hastily convened press
conference, McGuire claimed it was an "historic and proud day". But he
resigned days later amid a firestorm in an emotional end to his
22-year reign at the helm of the game's biggest club.

10. CROWS CAMP

Adelaide's devestating loss to Richmond in the 2017 grand final was
the driver behind a toxic pre-season camp held by the club in
Queensland in Janurary 2018 where players were subjected to extreme
physical, mental and allegedly cultural abuse. Claims of what
transpired including players being blindfolded, tied to trees and
subjected to personal taunts trigged an AFL integrity unit
investigation. The Crows were cleared of wrongdoing, but a series of
participants - including champion Eddie Betts and Josh Jenkins - have
since confirmed the trauma some in the group suffered. The Crows have
not made finals since.
