This talk is a demonstration of my sports2025 suite of programs to
follow AFL (Australian Football) and NRL (Rugby League) in 2025.

\section{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Good practice using Perl
  \item Produce Football ladders and tipping results on demand
  \item Be an electronic version of my physical A4 ``Sportsbook''
  \item Be extensible with new languages and methodologies
  \item A new version each year with improved code
  \item Other sports can be added with some effort and understanding
\end{itemize}

\section{AFL teams}

There are eighteen teams; ten in Melbourne, two each in Sydney, Brisbane,
Adelaide and Perth. A full round of football games has one game
Thursday night, one game Friday night, four games Saturday and three
games Sunday. Public holiday Mondays and Anzac Day will reshape those
rounds.

Each of the 18 teams have a unique three letter name. Testing scripts
ensure that the names entered for fixtures, results and tips files are
consistent.

\section{NRL teams}

There are seventeen teams; one in Melbourne, many in New South Wales
and four in Queensland. Most of the teams are known just as strongly
by their animal mascots, St George Dragons, Canberra Raiders,
Redcliffe Dolphins. The famous South Sydney team are the Rabbitohs, a
Rabbitoh is not a rabbit, but a \textit{seller} of Rabbit meat. During
the depression era of the 1930s, Rabbit meat was sold by a travelling
vendor called a Rabbitoh.

Two of the Sydney teams have abandoned their old suburban names
and now called themselves ``Sydney'' animals; Eastern Suburbs is now
the Sydney Roosters and Canterbury Bankstown is now the Sydney
Bulldogs. I reluctantly use the mascot names for these teams; ROO and
BUL.

The name checking Testing scripts bomb out a lot more for my NRL files
than they do for my AFL files.
